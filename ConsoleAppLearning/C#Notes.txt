Access Specifiers:
PUBLIC             - All the class members declared under public will be available to everyone
PRIVATE            - The class members declared as priavte can be accessed by the functions inside the class
PROTECTED          - The class members declared as protected are inaccessible outside the class but can be accessed by subclasses of the class
INTERNAL           - The class members declared as internal are accessible by other functions and objects lying within the assembly. Assembly is produced .dll or .exe from .NET Code
PROTECTED INTERNAL - Members are accessible withing the same assembly as well as inheritance. It is a combination of internal and protected Access Specifiers

<#>+ to add
There are Arithmetic Operators, Increment/Decrement Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Assignment Operators and Bitwise Operators

Summary:
Public    - Accessible from anywhere
Private   - Accessible only within the class
Protected - Accessible in derived classes
Internal  - Accessible withing the same assembly

Control Statements:
If
If Else
Else If Ladder
Nested If
Switch Case
While Loop
Do-While Loop
For Loop
Nested Loop

VOID DATA TYPE:
Used to specify that a method does not return any value
void cannot gold any data or be assaigned to a varaible
void performs an action but does not return anything

MULTITHREADING:
Lightwieght processes within a program
Each thread runs independently but shares memory
Threads allow multitasking and parallelism
Mutiple threads can exits within a single process

Mutiple states:
Unstarted
Running
WaitSleepJoin
Suspended
Stopped/Aborted

THREAD CLASS:
Allows creation and managment of threads
Provides methods
Allows setting thread priority and name

STEPS:
DEFINE the method to run
CREATE a ThreadStart delegate for the method
CREATE a Thread object
START the thread using Start()

Uses same system as python for if and else statements
