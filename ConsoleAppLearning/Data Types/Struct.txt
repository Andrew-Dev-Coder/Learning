/*
Struct in C# can wncapsulate data and related behaviour
Similar to a class but not a referrence type
Used for small data structuers, such as a point in 2D or 3D space or other simple objects where performance and memory effcience are important
Holds data directly
Cannot inherit from other structs or classes
Cannnot be the base of a class
Do not have a default parameterless constructor
Must start all fields before using them
Can implement interfaces
Cannnot have a base class
Efficent memory usage
