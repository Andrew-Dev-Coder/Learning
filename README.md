This repository shows some of my experience with learning different systems, including Kotlin, HTML and C#.
*I am learning Kotlin through the Android developer courses.
*I am learning HTML through FutureLearn HTML5 course.
*I am learning C# through an app made by OnePercent on my phone. 
The app can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=club.onepercent.csharp_tutorial&utm_source=emea_Med
Other languages that I know are currently Python and CSS.
