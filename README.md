This repository shows some of my experience with learning different systems, including Kotlin, HTML and C#.
* I am learning Kotlin through the Android developer courses. Which can be found here: https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course
* I am learning HTML through FutureLearn HTML5 course. Which can be found here: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/a-beginners-guide-to-web-development-with-html5
* I am learning C# through an app made by OnePercent on my phone. 
The app can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=club.onepercent.csharp_tutorial&utm_source=emea_Med
* Other languages that I know are currently Python and CSS.
