This repository shows some of my experience with learning different systems, including Kotlin, HTML and C#.
I am learning Kotlin through the Android developer courses.
I am learning HTML through FutureLearn HTML5 course.
I am learning C# through an app made by OnePercent on my phone.
Other languages that I know are currently Python and CSS.
